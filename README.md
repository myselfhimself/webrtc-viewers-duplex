## A WebRTC Viewers Duplex Proof-of-Concept

### Roadmap
1. Page1 + Node + Page2 (almost empty htmls).
   Send an event from Page1 to Page2.
2. Send webcam from Page1 to Page 2.
2. Bonus: plug in a facial recognition library to extract a face rectangular canvas out of the webcam signal.
3. Design Page2 UI.
4. Make Page2 players move according to Page1 keypresses.
